Assumptions

Users can schedule posts only for future dates.

Posts are not actually published to social media APIs.

Multiple platforms can be selected per post.

Posts are published in order of creation when multiple posts are scheduled at the same time.

Frontend UI prioritizes functionality over design (assessment requirement).

# Usage

Register a new user or login using demo credentials.

Navigate to Create Post to schedule posts.

Select one or multiple platforms, schedule a date/time, and optionally add an image URL.

View your posts in the Posts List (paginated).

Dashboard shows statistics and upcoming posts.
